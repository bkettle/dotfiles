# Ben's Dotfiles

In order to streamline my development, I switched to Linux recently (summer 2020). These are my configuration files, they are very much a WIP.

It relies on [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) for management.

## Main Tools
- i3 Window Manager
- Neovim
	- Vimtex & Zathura for LaTeX editing
- Zsh
